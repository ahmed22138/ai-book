/**
 * Creating a sidebar enables you to:
 - create an ordered group of docs
 - render a set of docs in the sidebar
 - provide next/previous navigation

 The sidebars can be generated from the filesystem, or explicitly defined here.

 Create as many sidebars as you want.

 NOTE: Phase 1 implementation uses simplified sidebar with only intro.
 Full 4-module structure will be added in Phase 3 (content creation).
